It Is Fully Compliant With The Targa Version 2.0 Specification Located Here: http://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~martino/disciplinas/ea978/tgaffs.pdf\r\n\r\n### **Why FastTarga?**\r\n\r\nMany Image Libraries Are Designed To Handle Many Different File Formats.  That Has It's Advantages For Sure, But It Also Has It's Draw Backs.  When Dealing With Libraries That Cater To Many Formats, The Library Has To Be Written And Designed With The Lowest Common Denominator Center Stage.  This Often Leads To Many Or Most Features Of A File Format To Be Completely Missing, Choosing To Only Implement Support For Reading And Writing Actual Pixel Data.  The Targa File Format, As Well As Many Others, Can Actually Describe More Information  Than Simply Pixel Data Such As Author Name, Thumbnails, Application-Specific User Data, And More.   Below Is A List Of Advantages Of Using **FastTarga**\r\n\r\n + *Full Specification Compliance For All Versions Including The Latest, Version 2.0*\r\n + *Full Support For All Specification Features Such As Developer And Extension Areas*\r\n + *Header Only Library.  Simply Include The Header And Be On Your Way*\r\n + *Implemented In Blazing Fast Optimized C++*\r\n + *Wrapper Libraries For C#, Java, And Python*\r\n\r\n### **Usage Instructions**\r\n\r\n#### **C++**\r\n\r\n*Simply Include The __TargaImage.h__ Header File In Your Project*\r\n\r\n#### **C#**\r\n\r\n*Simply Add __FastTarga.Net.dll__ As A Reference To Your Project*\r\n\r\n#### **Java**\r\n\r\n*Simply Import __FastTarga.jar__ Into Your Project*\r\n\r\n#### **Python**\r\n\r\n*Simply Import __FastTarga.py__ Into Your Project*\r\n\r\n>**Note:** *Make Sure That With Every Language, The Native __FastTarga.dll__ C++ Library Is Located Where The Application Can Find It (Usually In The Same Directory As Your Application).  For C++ Header-Only Builds, There Will Be No __FastTarga.dll__*\r\n\r\n### **Licence**\r\n#### BSD 2-Clause License (\"FreeBSD\") \r\n\r\n>Copyright (c) 2016, Precision Software & Engineering LLC (Richard Gerard Marcoux III)\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\n>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n>1.
