### <center>*A Blazing Fast Implementation Of The Tru-Vision Targa Image Format Specification*</center>

---

### **What Is FastTarga Exactly?**
A Blazing Fast Image Library Implemented Is C++ That Is Able To Read And Write Targa (.tga) Image Files.  It Is Fully Compliant With The Targa Version 2.0 Specification Located Here: http://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~martino/disciplinas/ea978/tgaffs.pdf

### **Why FastTarga?**

Many Image Libraries Are Designed To Handle Many Different File Formats.  That Has It's Advantages For Sure, But It Also Has It's Draw Backs.  When Dealing With Libraries That Cater To Many Formats, The Library Has To Be Written And Designed With The Lowest Common Denominator Center Stage.  This Often Leads To Many Or Most Features Of A File Format To Be Completely Missing, Choosing To Only Implement Support For Reading And Writing Actual Pixel Data.  The Targa File Format, As Well As Many Others, Can Actually Describe More Information  Than Simply Pixel Data Such As Author Name, Thumbnails, Application-Specific User Data, And More.   Below Is A List Of Advantages Of Using **FastTarga**

 + *Full Specification Compliance For All Versions Including The Latest, Version 2.0*
 + *Full Support For All Specification Features Such As Developer And Extension Areas*
 + *Header Only Library.  Simply Include The Header And Be On Your Way*
 + *Implemented In Blazing Fast Optimized C++*
 + *Wrapper Libraries For C#, Java, And Python*

### **Usage Instructions**

#### **C++**

*Simply Include The **TargaImage.h** Header File In Your Project*
